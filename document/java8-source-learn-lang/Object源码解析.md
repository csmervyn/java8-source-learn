## 1.Object类的定义
    /**
     * Class {@code Object} is the root of the class hierarchy.
     * Every class has {@code Object} as a superclass. All objects,
     * including arrays, implement the methods of this class.
     *
     * @author  unascribed
     * @see     java.lang.Class
     * @since   JDK1.0
     */
    public class Object {
      ...
    }
“Object类是class层次结构的根，每个class都以Object类作为其超类。所有的对象，包括数组都实现了Object类的方法。”  这两句话几乎被每个学习Java语言的人所熟知，但如何理解这两句话也困扰了好多人。我开始理解这两句话的时候有三个疑问：①新建一个没有继承其它类的类，java.lang.Object是如何成为该新创建类的默认父类的？②一个继承其它类的类，该类和Object类的关系？③新建一个类，可以显式继承java.lang.Object？
## 2.新建一个没有继承其它类的类，java.lang.Object是如何成为该新创建类的默认父类的？
参考文献[1]中的作者给出了一个观点：
* （1）、在编译源代码时，当遇到没有父类的类时，编译器会将其指定一个默认的父类（一般为Object），而虚拟机在处理到这个类时，由于这个类已经有一个默认的父类了，因此，VM仍然会按着常规的方法来处理每一个类。对于这种情况，从编译后的二进制角度来看，所有的类都会有一个父类<sup>[1]</sup>。
* （2）、编译器仍然按着实际代码进行编译，并不会做额外的处理。如果一个类没有显式地继承于其他的类，编译后的代码仍然没有父类。然后由虚拟机运行二进制代码时，当遇到没有父类的类时，就会自动将这个类看成是Object类的子类（一般这类语言的默认父类都是Object）<sup>[1]</sup>。
我们下面通过实验来验证，这种给没有父类的类指定默认父类java.lang.Object的功能是由编译器来实现的还是由虚拟机实现的。

首先新建一个没有继承其它类的类Person:

        public class Person{
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println(new Person().toString());
            }
        }
对Person类进行编译后的Person.class文件进行反编译为：

        public class Person
        {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
        System.out.println(new Person().toString());
        }
        }
从反编译后源码中可以看出，编译器并没有给Person类指定一个默认的父类（Object类）。通过证明，我们可以猜测Java虚拟机当遇到一个类没有父类的类时，就会自动将这个类看成是Object类的子类。
## 3.一个继承其它类的类，该类的父类是谁？
    public class Father {
        private String name;
    
        public Father() {
        }
    
        public Father(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
    public class Son extends Father{
        private String nickname;
    
        public Son(String nickname) {
            super();
            this.nickname = nickname;
        }
    }
因为Son类有其直接的父类Father类，所以Object类为Son类的间接父类。而Object类为Father类的直接父类。
## 4.新建一个类，可以显式继承java.lang.Object？
    public class Mokey extends Object{
      private String name;
      private double weight;
    
      public Mokey(String name, double weight) {
          this.name = name;
          this.weight = weight;
      }
    }
答案是肯定的，但是没有必要。对Mokey类的源码编译后的Mokey.class文件进行反编译为：

    public class Mokey
    {
      private String name;
      private double weight;
    
      public Mokey(String name, double weight)
      {
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = weight;
      }
    }
通过对比Mokey类的源码和反编译后的源码，可以看出编译器会将继承的Object类去掉。
## 5.常用方法分析
### getClass()
    /**
     * Returns the runtime class of this {@code Object}. The returned
     * {@code Class} object is the object that is locked by {@code
     * static synchronized} methods of the represented class.
     *
     * <p><b>The actual result type is {@code Class<? extends |X|>}
     * where {@code |X|} is the erasure of the static type of the
     * expression on which {@code getClass} is called.</b> For
     * example, no cast is required in this code fragment:</p>
     *
     * <p>
     * {@code Number n = 0;                             }<br>
     * {@code Class<? extends Number> c = n.getClass(); }
     * </p>
     *
     * @return The {@code Class} object that represents the runtime
     *         class of this object.
     * @jls 15.8.2 Class Literals
     */
    public final native Class<?> getClass();
getClass方法是一个本地方法，返回一个对象的运行时类。该方法不能被子类重写。
### clone() 
    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
     * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
     * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
     * will be true, and that the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
     * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
     * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.
     *
     * @return     a clone of this instance.
     * @throws  CloneNotSupportedException  if the object's class does not
     *               support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
     *               that override the {@code clone} method can also
     *               throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
     *               be cloned.
     * @see java.lang.Cloneable
     */
    protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
这个也是本地方法，同时也是一个受保护的方法。需要注意的是该方法是“浅拷贝”的。Object子类中，这个方法的行为取决于该子类是否实现了Cloneable接口。如果一个类实现了Cloneable接口，该类继承自Object类的clone方法返回该对象的逐域拷贝，否则就会抛出CloneNotSupportedException。如果要实现一个类对象的“深拷贝”，除非该类的所有超类都提供了行为良好的clone实现，无论是公有的还是受保护的方法，否则，都不可能这么做<sup>[2]</sup>。
### equals(Object obj)
    /**
     * Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
     * <p>
     * The {@code equals} method implements an equivalence relation
     * on non-null object references:
     * <ul>
     * <li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
     *     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
     *     {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
     *     should return {@code true} if and only if
     *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
     *     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
     *     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
     *     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
     *     objects is modified.
     * <li>For any non-null reference value {@code x},
     *     {@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The {@code equals} method for class {@code Object} implements
     * the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
     * that is, for any non-null reference values {@code x} and
     * {@code y}, this method returns {@code true} if and only
     * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
     * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).
     * <p>
     * Note that it is generally necessary to override the {@code hashCode}
     * method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
     * general contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which states
     * that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
     *
     * @param   obj   the reference object with which to compare.
     * @return  {@code true} if this object is the same as the obj
     *          argument; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @see     #hashCode()
     * @see     java.util.HashMap
     */
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
            return (this == obj);
    }
这不是一个非本地方法。用来比较两个Object对象是否是同一个对象。子类重写equals方法的时候，需要保证equals方法满足：①自反性②对称性③传递性④一致性⑤对于任何非null的引用值x,x.equals(null)必须返回false<sup>[2]</sup>。另外一点需注意：覆盖equals时总要覆盖hashCode方法。
### hashCode()
    /**
     * Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
     * supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
     * {@link java.util.HashMap}.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code hashCode} is:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     *     an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method
     *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
     * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
     * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
     * technique is not required by the
     * Java&trade; programming language.)
     *
     * @return  a hash code value for this object.
     * @see     java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)
     * @see     java.lang.System#identityHashCode
     */
    public native int hashCode();
这个方法是一个本地方法。子类重写这个方法的时候，需要满足注释中说的以上三点要求。并且在每个覆盖了equals方法的类中，也必须覆盖hashCode方法。另外一点需要注意的是，提供恰当的散列函数。
### toString()
    /**
     * Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
     * {@code toString} method returns a string that
     * "textually represents" this object. The result should
     * be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
     * person to read.
     * It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
     * <p>
     * The {@code toString} method for class {@code Object}
     * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
     * object is an instance, the at-sign character `{@code @}', and
     * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
     * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
     * value of:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())native
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @return  a string representation of the object.
     */
    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
    }
这是一个非本法方法。建议子类都覆盖这个方法，已提供值得关注的必要信息。便于日志的打印和排查问题。
### wait(long timeout)
    /**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or a
     * specified amount of time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor.
     * <p>
     * This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
     * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
     * any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
     * becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
     * until one of four things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
     * object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
     * the thread to be awakened.
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
     * object.
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
     * thread <var>T</var>.
     * <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
     * {@code timeout} is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
     * consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
     * </ul>
     * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
     * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
     * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
     * object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
     * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
     * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
     * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
     * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
     * was invoked.
     * <p>
     * A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
     * timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
     * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
     * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
     * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
     * waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
     *             obj.wait(timeout);
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
     * "Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
     * 2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
     * Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).
     *
     * <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
     * interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an
     * {@code InterruptedException} is thrown.  This exception is not
     * thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
     * described above.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code wait} method, as it places the current thread
     * into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
     * other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain
     * locked while the thread waits.

    public final native void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException;
该方法是一个本地方法。该方法会使当前线程等待，并释放自己持有的锁。使用该方法前需要获取当前对象的锁。当其他线程在同一个锁上调用notify或者notifyAll方法，或者wait方法已花费完了指定timeout毫秒。该方法用于线程间的协作。
### wait(long timeout, int nanos)
    /**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the

     * amount of real time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * This method is similar to the {@code wait} method of one
     * argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to
     * wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
     * measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>

     *     milliseconds plus {@code nanos} nanoseconds arguments, has
     *     elapsed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
     * monitor and resumes execution.

        wait(timeout);
    } 
该方法不是一个本地方法。该方法与wait(long timeout)作用一样。该方法会使当前线程等待，并释放自己持有的锁。当其他线程在同一个锁上调用notify或者notifyAll方法，或者wait方法已花费完了指定（1000000*timeout+nanos）纳秒。该方法用于线程间的协作。
### wait()
    /**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
     * {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object.
     * In other words, this method behaves exactly as if it simply
     * performs the call {@code wait(0)}.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
     * releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread
     * notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up
     * either through a call to the {@code notify} method or the
     * {@code notifyAll} method. The thread then waits until it can
     * re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
     *             obj.wait();
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of the object's monitor.
     * @throws  InterruptedException if any thread interrupted the
     *             current thread before or while the current thread
     *             was waiting for a notification.  The <i>interrupted
     *             status</i> of the current thread is cleared when
     *             this exception is thrown.
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notify()
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notifyAll()
     */
    public final void wait() throws InterruptedException {
        wait(0);
    } 
该方法不是一个本地方法。该方法会使当前线程等待，并释放自己持有的锁。当其他线程在同一个锁上调用notify或者notifyAll方法。该方法用于线程间的协作。
### notify()
    /**
     * Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's
     * monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them
     * is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at
     * the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's
     * monitor by calling one of the {@code wait} methods.
     * <p>
     * The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current
     * thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will
     * compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be
     * actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the
     * awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being
     * the next thread to lock this object.
     * <p>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the
     * object's monitor in one of three ways:
     * <ul>
     * <li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.
     * <li>By executing the body of a {@code synchronized} statement
     *     that synchronizes on the object.
     * <li>For objects of type {@code Class,} by executing a
     *     synchronized static method of that class.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notifyAll()
     * @see        java.lang.Object#wait()
     */
    public final native void notify();
这是一个本地方法，该方法会随机选择一个在其所持有的锁上等待的一个线程，将该线程唤醒。
### notifyAll()
    /**
     * Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A
     * thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the
     * {@code wait} methods.
     * <p>
     * The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current
     * thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened threads
     * will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
     * be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example,
     * the awakened threads enjoy no reliable privilege or disadvantage in
     * being the next thread to lock this object.

     *
     * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
     *               the owner of this object's monitor.
     * @see        java.lang.Object#notify()
     * @see        java.lang.Object#wait()
     */
    public final native void notifyAll();
这是一个本地方法，该方法将其所持有的锁上等待的所有线程唤醒。
